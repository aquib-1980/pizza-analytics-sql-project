🍕 The Great Pizza Analytics Challenge – SQL Project
SQL Challenge (by DPDzero × Indian Data Club)

This project is my submission for the Great Pizza Analytics Challenge, where I analyzed real pizza sales data using SQL. The goal was to work through a full analytics workflow — from data inspection to generating business insights — using the .dump database file provided in the challenge.

📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains multiple tables covering pizzas, orders, categories, prices, and order details.
I used SQL to explore, clean, and analyze the complete dataset while answering all challenge questions.

🔧 Skills & Concepts Used

Database creation & schema exploration
Filtering using WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE
Cleaning missing data with COALESCE
Aggregations: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX
Grouping & filtering using GROUP BY + HAVING
Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, SELF JOIN

Identifying missing values & incomplete records

Working with real-world transactional data

📊 Key Insights & Analysis

During this challenge, I analyzed:

Top-performing pizza categories
Daily and date-specific order trends
Total pizzas sold and average prices
Unordered pizzas (zero sales items)
Pizzas with missing price or ingredient information
Category-wise sales performance
Price variations across different sizes of the same pizza
Total order amount per order (using joins + aggregation)

🧠 What I Gained From This Project

Improved SQL logic-building and analytical thinking
Practical experience handling a multi-table relational database
Hands-on exposure to joins, aggregations, and data cleaning
Stronger understanding of how raw data turns into business insights

This challenge was a great step forward in my data analytics journey, and I look forward to building more such projects!
